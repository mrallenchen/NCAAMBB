College Basketball is notoriously hard to predict. There's a reason why the annual tournament is most widely known as March Madness.

Yet there is still tremendous interest in predicting the outcome of games. From sports betting to office pools, many avenues for people to make their own predictions of the outcome.

While there are many models out there, I would also like to try to build my own version to predict basketball outcomes.
